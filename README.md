# Housing Association

This is my little project to improve inter-neighbor relationships in my own
little housing association.

I will be using Github for planning features, so please submit issues and pull
requests if you have an idea you think would be cool.

## Initial setup

You'll need [node](http://nodejs.org/) or [io.js](https://iojs.org/), since the
application is set up to run an [Express.js](http://expressjs.com) server.

Just for the sake of being hipster, we'll use **io.js** today.

### Step 1: Install dependencies

    npm install

### Step 2: run the backend
There isn't a frontend build quite yet, so let's just get everything up and
running:

    iojs app.js
